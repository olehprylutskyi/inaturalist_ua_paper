# State-of-the-art of iNaturalist as a source of data on Ukrainian Funga
Repository contains data and script to reproduce all analysis and visualizations from the manuscript "State-of-the-art of iNaturalist as a source of data on Ukrainian Funga".

This study evaluates the utility of iNaturalist, a citizen science platform, for mycological research in Ukraine. With over 69,000 fungal observations documented since its adoption, iNaturalist presents a significant potential for supplementing professional mycological surveys. This work is novel in critically analysing the spatial distribution, taxonomic coverage, and identification accuracy of iNaturalist fungal data, with a particular focus on social processes underlying citizen scientists' activity in Ukraine over the last five years. We explored observers' activity and compared iNaturalist records with curated checklists and additional data sources. Despite inherent biases, our analysis shows that iNaturalist effectively documents conspicuous macroscopic fungi, often surpassing traditional sources in record numbers. However, limitations such as identification uncertainty and lack of voucher specimens persist, necessitating greater professional engagement. Enhanced collaboration between amateur and professional mycologists could unlock iNaturalist’s full potential, making it a robust tool for biodiversity monitoring and research in Ukraine.

**Figure 1. Taxonomic credibility of iNaturalist fungal data from Ukraine.** (a) –  Accumulation of species with the accumulation of observations. The solid line highlights rarefied existing data, the dashed line is a projection for future observation growth, and the shaded area is a 95% credible interval. (b) – Identification activity. The Y axis displays the number of published observations, dissected by the number of identification disagreements (in colour). Fewer agreements/disagreements reflect the lower engagement of another user in identifying particular observations. (c, d) – Taxonomic coverage for the two groups of fungi – gilled representatives of Order Agaricales (c), the largest order of mushroom-forming Basidiomycota, and Order Lecanorales (d), one of the largest order of lichen-forming Ascomycota, respectively. Colours reflect the data source, where red is iNaturalist data, and green is the latest national checklists for respective groups; the bar length is proportional to the number of species reported for the territory of Ukraine. N indicates number of respective species.

**Figure 2. Spatial distribution of iNaturalist fungal data from Ukraine.** (a) – Gridded density of iNaturalist fungal observations, published as of 1st June 2024 for the territory of Ukraine. A grid cell is 1000 km2; cells lacking observations are left colourless. (b) – Population density in Ukraine as of 2020 y., as a reference of potential observers’ distribution. The two major cities, as well as mountain ranges, are labelled. Data source: Gridded Population of the World, Version 4 (GPWv4): Population Density, Revision 11 (https://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/data/set/gpw-v4-population-density-rev11). (c, d) – Georeferenced records of protected species Hericium coralloides (c) and invasive species Clathrus archeri (d). The colour indicates a data source: red is for iNaturalist observations, and green is for records from any other sources (academic publications, collections, reports from social media). N indicates number of respective resords.

**Figure 3. The social facet of fungal part of iNaturalist activity in Ukraine.** (a) – Accumulation of fungal observations made on Ukraine's territory since the platform's launch. Colours highlight the two major social events for the period – the COVID-19 pandemic and the full-scale Russian invasion. (b) –  Accumulation of fungal observations for each administrative region of Ukraine separately for 2019-2023 years. The brighter colour indicates a higher total number of regional observations by the end of a respective year. (c) – Yearly changes in observers' activity. Regions where the total number of observations made in a given year was higher than that made in a preceding year are highlighted in red. Regions where the total number of observations made in a given year was lower than that made in a preceding year are highlighted in blue. Colour saturation reflects the magnitude of the difference. The white colour indicates no changes (zero point). (d) – All political violence events (combat, shelling, casualties) caused by the Russian-Ukrainian war since the beginning of the full-scale invasion, as a reference to the spatial impact of the war.

# Data
All data are stored into the `data` subfolder.

We downloaded an archive of all observations, available on iNaturalist as of 1 June 2024, and meet the following criteria: (i) lie within the official state boundary of Ukraine, (ii) belong to the Fungi Kingdom, and (iii) verifiable (accompanied by photos). Total number of downloaded records was 69,211.

The state boundary of Ukraine, as well as its administrative division, was acquired using the rgeoboundaries package v. 1.2.9 (Dicko 2023). Population density data for Ukraine were acquired from the Gridded Population of the World, Version 4 (GPWv4): Population Density, Revision 11 (https://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/data/set/gpw-v4-population-density-rev11). Ukrainian war events data were downloaded from ACLED's Ukraine Conflict Monitor (https://acleddata.com/ukraine-conflict-monitor/).
